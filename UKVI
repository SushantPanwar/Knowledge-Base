## UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)

**What is UKVI?**

The UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) is a government agency responsible for managing all visa applications and immigration matters for the United Kingdom. They assess applications, make decisions, and provide guidance on various visa routes, including:

* Visiting the UK
* Studying in the UK
* Working in the UK
* Settling in the UK

**Do I need a UKVI interview?**

Not everyone applying for a UK visa needs an interview. Whether you'll be invited for one depends on several factors:

* **Visa type:** Certain visa types, such as student visas, are more likely to require an interview.
* **Application details:** Inconsistencies, discrepancies, or unusual circumstances in your application might trigger an interview request.
* **Random selection:** In some cases, UKVI might select applicants randomly for interviews to verify information or assess eligibility further.

**How will I know if I need an interview?**

If you are required to attend an interview, UKVI will notify you through email or SMS. The notification will provide details about the date, time, and location of the interview.

**What happens if I miss my interview?**

It's crucial to attend the interview if invited. Failing to do so without a valid reason (such as illness with medical documentation) can lead to your visa application being refused.
